It shuffles a deck of virtual tarot cards using os.urandom (system randomness) and then draws 3 cards also using os.urandom(). Displays images of the 3 cards and a brief reminder of what they represent in a popup window. 
Made with a lot of help from Meta AI as this is my first project.

Don't run it too many times in a row as I think it will deplete your system's entropy pool and temporarily make the readings less random.

Either download Meta Tarot 3.exe as the standalone little program, or download the whole thing as a zip to check out the code and build it yourself. 

Have fun!
